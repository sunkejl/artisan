PHP 4.3.0RC4 Released
   Despite our best efforts, it was necessary to make one more release
   candidate, hence PHP 4.3.0RC4. This one mainly corrects the CGI vs CLI SAPI
   naming and fixes a couple of bugs. It is supposed to have a short testing
   cycle, after which the final version will be put out, hopefully before the
   end of the year.
