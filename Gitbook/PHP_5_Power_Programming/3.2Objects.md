3.2. Objects

属性
The properties are the object's data, which basically means the variables that belong to the object. 
方法
The methods if you are coming from a functional background are basically the functions that the object supports.
接口
Going one step further, the functionality that is intended for other objects to be accessed and used during interaction is called an object's interface.


the class represents a person. 
类代表人类
For each person in your application, you can make a separate instance of this class that represents the person's information. 
对于每一个人，可以创造一个分开的实例来代表每一个人的信息
For example, 
if two people in our application are called Joe and Judy, 
we would create two separate instances of this class and would call the setName() method of each with their names to initialize the variable holding the person's name, 
$name. The methods and members that other interacting objects may use are a class's contract. 
In this example, the person's contracts to the outside world are the two set and get methods, setName() and getName().
变量设置为私有，由set 和 get 和外部联系


3.4  The new Keyword and Constructors

Because a constructor cannot return a value, the most common practice for raising an error from within the constructor is by throwing an exception.

constructor 函数没有返回值，发生错误时用抛出异常的方法

3.5. Destructors
 
Destructor functions are the opposite of constructors. 
和constructor 相对立
They are called when the object is being destroyed (for example, when there are no more references to the object).
在对象被销毁时调用,如对象不存在引用
PHP makes sure all resources are freed at the end of each request
php在所有请求完成时释放资源
logging information on object destruction.
可以用来记录日志

```php
class MyClass  {
    function __destruct()
    {
        print "An object of type MyClass is being destroyed\n";
    }
}

$obj = new MyClass();
$obj = NULL;
```
In this example, when $obj = NULL; is reached, 
the only handle to the object is destroyed, and therefore the destructor is called, and the object itself is destroyed. 
唯一引用该对象的被销毁了，destructor被调用
Even without the last line, the destructor would be called, 
but it would be at the end of the request during the execution engine's shutdown.
如果没有手动销毁，在当前执行的请求关闭时也会被触发

注意可能不是请求关闭触发的，而是由最后一个引用导致的触发
