a special variable called $this is automatically defined, which denotes a reference to the object itself.
$this 自动定义好 是该对象的引用

3.6.3. Static Properties
classes can declare properties. Each instance of the class (i.e., object) has its own copy of these properties. 
每个类的实例都有自己复制出来的属性
However, a class can also contain static properties. 
Unlike regular properties, these belong to the class itself and not to any instance of it.
静态属性 属于类，不属于任何实例
Therefore, they are often called class properties as opposed to object or instance properties. 
类的属性 不是对象的属性
You can also think of static properties as global variables 
that sit inside a class but are accessible from anywhere via the class.
全局变量  放在类里 可以在任何地方通过类访问

One example of using it is to assign a unique id to all instances of a class:
使用场景
```php
class MyUniqueIdClass {
    static $idCounter = 0;

    public $uniqueId;

    function __construct()
    {
        self::$idCounter++;
        $this->uniqueId = self::$idCounter;
    }
}

$obj1 = new MyUniqueIdClass();
print $obj1->uniqueId . "\n";
$obj2 = new MyUniqueIdClass();
print $obj2->uniqueId . "\n";
```

An even better example for using static property is in a singleton pattern, which is demonstrated in the next chapter.
常用于单例模式


3.6.4. Static Methods

static methods are part of the class and are not bound to any specific object instance and its properties.
静态方法属于类 不属于实例
Therefore, $this isn't accessible in these methods, 
$this 无法访问这些方法
but the class itself is by using self to access it. 
可以用self去访问它
Because static methods aren't bound to any specific object, 
you can call them without creating an object instance by using the class_name::method() syntax.
由于不属于任何实例 可以不实例化对象就能访问
自己调用用self 调用父类的静态方法 用parent
