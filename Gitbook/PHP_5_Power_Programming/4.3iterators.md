4.3. Iterators
 
However, often when you write object-oriented code, 
your classes don't necessarily represent a simple key/value array as in the previous example,
but represent more complex data, such as a database query or a configuration file.

PHP 5 allows you to overload the behavior of the foreach() iteration from within your code 
so you can have it do what makes sense in respect to your class's design.

迭代器


If your class implements the Iterator interface, it will be traversable with foreach().
如果实现了Iterator的接口,就可以通过foreach对对象进行循环
