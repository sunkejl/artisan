3.15. final Methods
Until now, you have seen that when you extend a class (or inherit from a class),
you may override inherited methods with a new implementation. 
如果继承了某个类，你可以重写继承的方法
However, there are times where you might want to make sure that a method cannot be re-implemented in its derived classes.
有时需要保证父类的方法不能被重写
For this purpose, 
PHP supports the Java-like final access modifier for methods 
that declares the method as the final version, which can't be overridden.
如果一个方法被定义为final,则不能被重写
 

3.16. final Classes
Similar to final methods, you can also define a class as final. 
可以把类定义为final
Doing so disallows inheriting from this class. The following code does not work:
声明为final的类不能被继承

下面的例子是错误的示范
```php
final class MyBaseClass {
    ...
}

class MyConcreteClass extends MyBaseClass {
    ...
}
```
 
3.17. __toString() Method
 ```php
class Person {
    function __construct($name)
    {
        $this->name = $name;
    }

    function __toString()
    {
        return $this->name;
    }

    private $name;
}

$obj = new Person("Andi Gutmans");
print $obj;
```
The __toString() method is currently only called by the print and echo language constructs. 
__toString()方法是在以print和echo时被触发

In the future, they will probably also be called by common string operations, 
such as string concatenation and explicit casting to string.
