3.19. __autoload()
When writing object-oriented code, it is often customary to put each class in its own source file. 
面向对象的代码中，经常把类放在各自的原文件中
The advantage of this is that it's much easier to find where a class is placed,
这样很容易找到类所在的位置
and it also minimizes the amount of code that needs to be included because you only include exactly the classes you need.
这样也使你所需要包含的类文件最少，只有需要用到的才被包含进来
The downside is that you often have to include tons and tons of source files, 
which can be a pain, often leading to including too many files and a code-maintenance headache.
__autoload() solves this problem by not requiring you to include classes you are about to use. 
__autoload函数可以不用预先加载类
If an __autoload() function is defined (only one such function can exist per application)
and you access a class that hasn't been defined, 
it will be called with the class name as a parameter.
如果定义的类无法访问，autoload会被调用传递,把类名当参数传递给autoload
This gives you a chance to include the class just in time.
If you successfully include the class, 
your source code continues executing as if the class had been defined.
If you don't successfully include the class, the scripting engine raises a fatal error about the class not existing.
如果无法成功加载，脚本就会报错类不存在

Here's a typical example using __autoload():
```php
MyClass.php:

<?php

class MyClass {
    function printHelloWorld()
    {
        print "Hello, World\n";
    }
}

?>


general.inc:

<?php

function __autoload($class_name)
{
    require_once($_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"] . "/classes/ $class_name.php");
}

?>


main.php:

<?php

require_once "general.inc";

$obj = new MyClass();
$obj->printHelloWorld();
```
`

Although classes in PHP are case-insensitive, 
case is preserved when sending the class name to __autoload(). 
If you prefer your classes' file names to be case-sensitive,
make sure you are consistent in your code, 
and always use the correct case for your classes.
在自动加载时，保证类名的大小写和文件名一直
If you prefer not to do so, 
you can use the strtolower() function to lowercase the class name before trying to include it,
and save the classes under lowercased file names.
如果想要特殊处理，用strtolower进行转换
