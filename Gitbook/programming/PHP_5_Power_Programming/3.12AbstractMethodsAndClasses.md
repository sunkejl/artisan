3.12. Abstract Methods and Classes
When designing class hierarchies, 
you might want to partially leave certain methods for inheriting classes to implement.
在设计类时，留一些方法给子类去实现

class be called an abstract class,
meaning that it's not a class with complete functionality and is only meant to be inherited from.
抽象类 说明他不是不是有完整方法的类，只是规范了子类的实现

You can define any number of methods as abstract, but once at least one method of a class is defined as abstract, 
你可以定义任意数量的方法为抽象发放，但是只要有一个方法定义为抽象方法，它的类就必须定义为抽象类
the entire class needs to be declared as abstract, too. 
This double definition exists to give you the option to define a class abstract even if it doesn't have any abstract methods, 
抽象类 可以没有抽象方法
and to force you to define a class with abstract methods as abstract so that it is clear to others what you had in mind.
有抽象方法的类一定是抽象类

PHP, a method is either abstract (without code) or it's fully defined.
一个方法如果是抽象方法（没有实际代码）,如果不是抽象方法则一定有
