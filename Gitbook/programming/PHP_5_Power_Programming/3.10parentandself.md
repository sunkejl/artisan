3.10. parent:: and self::
 
PHP supports two reserved class names that make it easier when writing OO applications. 
self:: refers to the current class and it is usually used to access static members, methods, and constants. 
self 当前类 调用 静态属性 静态方法 和常量是使用
parent:: refers to the parent class and it is most often used when wanting to call the parent constructor or methods. 
parent 父类 当想要调用父类的初始化和方法时
It may also be used to access members and constants. 

You should use parent:: as opposed to the parent's class name because it makes it easier to change your class hierarchy 
because you are not hard-coding the parent's class name.
建议用parent 而是父类的类名 避免硬编码
