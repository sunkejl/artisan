3.13. Interfaces

PHP chose interfaces as an alternative to multiple inheritance, 
选择了接口来实现多个继承
which allows you to specify additional contracts a class must follow. 
声明额外的方法 子类必须要实现
An interface is declared similar to a class but only includes function prototypes (without implementation) and constants. 
接口里的方法只有方法原型,和常量
```php
interface I{
    function d();
}
```
Any class that "implements" this interface automatically has the interface's constants defined and,
实现了接口的类自动拥有接口定义的常量
as the implementing class, needs to supply the function definitions for the interface's function prototypes that are all abstract methods 
(unless you declare the implementing class as abstract).
实现了该接口的类需要对接口中的方法进行实现,如果是抽象类实现了接口就不需要实现

To implement an interface, use the following syntax:
```php
class A implements B, C, ... {
    ...
}
```

Classes that implement an interface have an instanceof (is-a) relationship with the interface; 
实现了某个接口的类可以用instanceof来确定和接口的关系
```php
$obj = new A();
if ($obj instanceof myInterface) {
    print '$obj is-A myInterface';
}
```
Interfaces are always considered to be public;
接口中的方法是public
therefore, you can't specify access modifiers for the method prototypes in the interface's declaration.
无法在接口的定义中进行访问控制

You may not implement multiple interfaces that clash with each other (for example, interfaces that define the same constants or methods).
不要实现多个有冲突的接口，如定义了相同常量和方法


3.14. Inheritance of Interfaces
Interfaces may inherit from other interfaces. 
接口可以继承多个接口
The syntax is similar to that of classes, but allows multiple inheritance:
```php
interface I1 extends I2, I3, ... {
    ...
}
```
Similar to when classes implement interfaces, 
an interface can only extend other interfaces if they don't clash with each other 
(which means that you receive an error if I2 defines methods or constants already defined by I1).
和类实现多个接口类似，一个接口是能继承多个不冲突的接口，如果俩个俩个接口定义了相同的常量和方法
