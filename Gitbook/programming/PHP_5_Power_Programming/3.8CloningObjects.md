3.8. Cloning Objects
When creating an object (using the new keyword), 
the returned value is a handle to an object or, in other words, the id number of the object. 
This is unlike PHP 4, where the value was the object itself.
不同于php4,php5对象传递不是赋值传递，是引用传递

```php
class MyClass {
    public $var = 1;
}

$obj1 = new MyClass();
$obj2 = $obj1;
$obj2->var = 2;
print $obj1->var;
```

Sometimes, though, you really do want to create a copy of the object. How can you achieve that? The solution is the language construct clone. 
当需要赋值时，可以用克隆 clone 来处理
```php
$obj2 = clone $obj1;
```
