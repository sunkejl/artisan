3.7. Class Constants
Global constants have existed in PHP for a long time. 
These could be defined using the define() function, which was described in Chapter 2, "PHP 5 Basic Language." 
With improved encapsulation support in PHP 5, you can now define constants inside classes. 
Similar to static members, 
they belong to the class and not to instances of the class. 
Class constants are always case-sensitive. 
The declaration syntax is intuitive, and accessing constants is similar to accessing static members:

define 不能在类里直接定义 需要放在类外，函数中可以定义，执行会报错
const 类似 静态属性 属于类 不属于实例 访问和静态属性一样

常用于定义不会变化的数据，如数据库用户名

As with global constants, you should write constant names in uppercase letters, because this is a common practice.
规范 是大写
