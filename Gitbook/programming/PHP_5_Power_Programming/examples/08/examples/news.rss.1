	<title>PHP 4.3.0RC4 Released</title>

	<description>   Despite our best efforts, it was necessary to make one more release candidate, hence PHP 4.3.0RC4. This one mainly corrects the CGI vs CLI SAPI naming and fixes a couple of bugs. It is supposed to have a short testing cycle, after which the final version will be put out, hopefully before the end of the year.  </description>

	<link>http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#access-keys</link>
	<description>   We introduced new keyboard shortcuts on the site today to make our pages even more comfortable to use. You can hit Alt+S on Microsoft Windows or Ctrl+S on Macintosh now to go right to the search box and type your search keyword. A similar shortcut with the letter &quot;L&quot; is also introduced on the manual pages to access the lookup input field. Thanks to Tommy Ipsen for the suggestion. You can read more about keyboard shortcuts on web pages in the HTML standard.  </description>
