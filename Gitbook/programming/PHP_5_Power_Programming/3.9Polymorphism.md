3.9. Polymorphism
多态
The subject of polymorphism is probably the most important in OOP. 
多态是面向对象里面最重要的
Using classes and inheritance makes it easy to describe a real-life situation as opposed to just a collection of functions and data. 
使用类和继承可以更简单的处理
They also make it much easier to grow projects by reusing code mainly via inheritance.
更简单的重用代码通过继承
Also, to write robust and extensible code, 
为了写更健壮和可扩展的代码
you usually want to have as few as possible flow-control statements (such as if() statements). 
尽可能少用 if这些条件控制语句
Polymorphism answers all these needs and more.

```php
function printTheRightSound($obj)
{
    if ($obj instanceof Cat) {
        $obj->miau();
    } else if ($obj instanceof Dog) {
        $obj->wuff();
    } else {
        print "Error: Passed wrong kind of object";
    }
    print "\n";
}
```
可以看出来，以上的代码不可扩展,如果需要再加一类 就得再加一个else if


Polymorphism using inheritance solves this problem. 
多态用集成解决了上面的问题
It enables you to inherit from a parent class, 
inheriting all its methods and properties and thus creating an is-a relationship.
创造一个父类 子类继承它的属性和方法
如果子类属于父类 直接调用方法
```php
  if ($obj instanceof Animal) {
        $obj->makeSound();
    } 
```


Certain modifiers available to you in PHP can give you more control over the inheritance process. 
They are covered in detail later in this chapter. 
For example, the class Animal and its method makeSound() can be marked as being abstract, 
which not only means that you don't have to give some meaningless implementation for the makeSound() definition in the Animal class, 
but also forcing any inheriting classes to implement it. 
使用abstract 抽象方法定义 强制子类实现这个方法
Additionally, we could specify access modifiers to the makeSound() method, such as the public modifier, meaning that it can be called anywhere in your code.

php不能继承多个，当有这个需求时，可以选择接口 interfaces
