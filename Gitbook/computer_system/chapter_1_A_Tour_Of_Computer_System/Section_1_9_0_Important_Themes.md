Important Themes

This concludes our initial whirlwind tour of systems. 

An important idea to take away from this discussion is that a system is more than just hardware. 

It is a collection of intertwined hardware and systems software that must cooperate 
in order to achieve the ultimate goal of running application programs. 

The rest of this book will fill in some details about the hardware and the software, 

and it will show how, by knowing these details, 

you can write programs that are faster, 

more reliable, and more secure.

To close out this chapter, 

we highlight several important concepts that cut across all aspects of computer systems. 

We will discuss the importance of these concepts at multiple places within the book.
