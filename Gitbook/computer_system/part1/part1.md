Part I
Program Structure and Execution

our exploration of computer systems starts by studying the computer itself, 
comprising a processor and a memory subsystem. 

At the core, we require ways to represent basic data types, 

such as approximations to integer and real arithmetic. 

From there we can consider how machine-level instructions manipulate data 

and how a compiler translates C programs into these instructions. 

Next, we study several methods of implementing a processor to 
gain a better understanding of how hardware resources are used to execute instructions. 

Once we understand compilers and machine-level code, 

we can examine how to maximize program performance by writing C programs that, 

when compiled, achieve the maximum possible performance. 

We conclude with the design of the memory subsystem, one of the most complex components of a modern computer system.

This part of the book will give you a deep understanding of how application programs are represented and executed. 

You will gain skills that help you write programs that are secure, reliable, and make the best use of the computing resources.
