Advice on Signed vs. Unsigned

As we have seen, the implicit casting of signed to unsigned leads to some non-intuitive behavior. 

Nonintuitive features often lead to program bugs, and ones involving the nuances of implicit casting can be especially difficult to see. 

Since the casting takes place without any clear indication in the code, 

programmers often overlook its effects. The following two practice problems illustrate some of the subtle errors that
can arise due to implicit casting and the unsigned data type.
