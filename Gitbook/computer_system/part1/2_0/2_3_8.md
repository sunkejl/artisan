Final Thoughts on Integer Arithmetic

As we have seen, the “integer” arithmetic performed by computers is really a form of modular arithmetic. 

The finite word size used to represent numbers limits the range of possible values, and the resulting operations can overflow. 

We have also seen that the two’s-complement representation provides a clever way to be able to represent both negative and positive values, 

while using the same bit-level implementations as are used to perform unsigned arithmetic—operations 
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and even division have either identical or very similar bit-level behaviors whether the operands are in unsigned or two’s-complement form.
