2.1.2
Words

Every computer has a word size, 

indicating the nominal size of integer and pointer data. 

Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, 

the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space. 

That is, for a machine with a w-bit word size, 

the virtual addresses can range from 0 to 2 pow(w) − 1, 

giving the program access to at most 2 pow(w) bytes.

Most personal computers today have a 32-bit word size. 

This limits the virtual address space to 4 gigabytes (written 4 GB), 

that is, just over 4 × 10 pow(9) bytes. 

Although this is ample space for most applications, 

we have reached the point where many large-scale scientific and database applications require larger amounts of storage.
 
Consequently, high-end machines with 64-bit word sizes are becoming increasingly common as storage costs decrease. 

As hardware costs drop over time, even desktop and laptop machines will switch to 64-bit word sizes, 

and so we will consider the general case of a w-bit word size, as well as the special cases of w = 32 and w = 64.
