Floating-Point Operations

The IEEE standard specifies a simple rule for determining the result of an arithmetic operation 
such as addition or multiplication. 

Viewing floating-point values x and y as real numbers, 
and some operation  defined over real numbers, the computation should yield Round(x,y), 

the result of applying rounding to the exact result of the real operation. 

In practice, there are clever tricks floating-point unit designers use to avoid performing this exact computation, 

since the computation need only be sufficiently precise to guarantee 
a correctly rounded result.

When one of the arguments is a special value such as −0, ∞, or NaN, 

the standard specifies conventions that attempt to be reasonable. 

For example, 1/ − 0 is defined to yield −∞, while 1/ + 0 is defined to yield +∞.

One strength of the IEEE standard’s method of specifying the behavior of 
floating-point operations is that 
it is independent of any particular hardware or software realization. 

Thus, we can examine its abstract mathematical properties without considering how it is actually implemented.
