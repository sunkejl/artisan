Integer Arithmetic

Many beginning programmers are surprised to find that adding two positive numbers can yield a negative result, 

and that the comparison x < y can yield a different result than the comparison x-y < 0. 

These properties are artifacts of the finite nature of computer arithmetic. 

Understanding the nuances of computer arithmetic can help programmers write more reliable code.
