IEEE Floating-Point Representation

Positional notation such as considered in the previous section would not be efficient for representing very large numbers. 

For example, the representation of 5 × 2^100 would consist of the bit pattern 101 followed by 100 zeros. 

Instead, we would like to represent numbers in a form x * 2 ^ y by giving the values of x and y.

The IEEE floating-point standard represents a number in a form V = (−1)^s * M * 2^E :

The sign s determines whether the number is negative (s = 1) or positive (s = 0), 
where the interpretation of the sign bit for numeric value 0 is handled as a special case.

The significand M is a fractional binary number that ranges either between 1 and 2 or between 0 and 1.

The exponent E weights the value by a (possibly negative) power of 2.

The bit representation of a floating-point number is divided into three fields to encode these values:

Standard floating-point formats.

Floating-point numbers are represented by three fields. 
For the two most common formats, these are packed in 32-bit (single precision) or 64-bit (double precision) words.
