2.3.6
Multiplying by Constants

On most machines, the integer multiply instruction is fairly slow, 
requiring 10 or more clock cycles, 

whereas other integer operations—such as addition, subtraction, bit-level operations, 
and shifting—require only 1 clock cycle. 

As a consequence, one important optimization used by compilers is to attempt to replace multiplications 
by constant factors with combinations of shift and addition operations. 

We will first consider the case of multiplying by a power of 2, and then generalize this to arbitrary constants.
