Dividing by Powers of Two

Integer division on most machines is even slower than integer multiplication—requiring 30 or more clock cycles. 

Dividing by a power of 2 can also be performed using shift operations, 
but we use a right shift rather than a left shift. 

The two different shifts—logical and arithmetic—serve this purpose for unsigned and two’s- complement numbers, respectively.
