2.2.6
Expanding the Bit Representation of a Number

One common operation is to convert between integers having different word sizes while retaining the same numeric value. 

Of course, this may not be possible when the destination data type is too small to represent the desired value. 

Converting from a smaller to a larger data type, however, should always be possible. 


```
short sx = -12345; /* -12345 */
unsigned short usx = sx; /* 53191 */
int x = sx; /* -12345 */
unsigned ux = usx; /* 53191 */
```

```
sx = -12345: cf c7
usx = 53191: cf c7
x = -12345: ff ff cf c7
ux = 53191: 00 00 cf c7
```
