Logical Operations in C

C also provides a set of logical operators ||, &&, and !, 

which correspond to the Or, And, and Not operations of logic. 

These can easily be confused with the bit-level operations, 
but their function is quite different. 

The logical operations treat any nonzero argument as representing True 
and argument 0 as representing False.

They return either 1 or 0, 
indicating a result of either True or False, respectively.

Here are some examples of expression evaluation:

Observe that a bit-wise operation will have behavior matching that of its logical
counterpart only in the special case in which the arguments are restricted to 0 or 1.

A second important distinction between the logical operators && and || versus 
their bit-level counterparts & and | is that the logical operators do not evaluate
their second argument if the result of the expression 
can be determined by evaluating the first argument. 

Thus, for example, the expression a && 5/a will never cause a division by zero, 
and the expression p && *p++ will never cause the dereferencing of a null pointer.
