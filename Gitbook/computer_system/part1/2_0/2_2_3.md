2.2.3
Two’s-Complement Encodings

For many applications, we wish to represent negative values as well. 

The most common computer representation of signed numbers is known as two’s-complement form. 

This is defined by interpreting the most significant bit of the word to have negative weight. 


```
0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 5
−8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = −5
−8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = −1
```


In the figure, we indicate that the sign bit has negative weight by showing it as a leftward-pointing gray bar. 

The numeric value associated with a bit vector is then given by the combination of the possible leftward-pointing gray bar 
and the rightward-pointing blue bars.
