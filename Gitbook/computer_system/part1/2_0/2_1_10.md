shift Operations in C

C also provides a set of shift operations for shifting bit patterns to the left and to the right. 

That is, x is shifted k bits to the left, 
dropping off the k most significant bits and filling the right end with k zeros. 

The shift amount should be a value between 0 and n − 1. 

Shift operations associate from left to right, so x << j << k is equivalent to (x << j) << k.

There is a corresponding right shift operation x >> k, but it has a slightly
subtle behavior. Generally, machines support two forms of right shift: logical
and arithmetic. A logical right shift fills the left end with k zeros, giving a result
[0, . . . , 0, x n−1 , x n−2 , . . . x k ]. An arithmetic right shift fills the left end with k repe-
titions of the most significant bit, giving a result [x n−1 , . . . , x n−1 , x n−1 , x n−2 , . . . x k ].
This convention might seem peculiar, but as we will see it is useful for operating
on signed integer data.
As examples, the following table shows the effect of applying the different
shift operations to some sample 8-bit data:
