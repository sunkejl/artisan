2.3.1
Unsigned Addition

Consider two nonnegative integers x and y, such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2 w − 1. 

Each of these numbers can be represented by w-bit unsigned numbers. 

If we compute their sum, however, we have a possible range 0 ≤ x + y ≤ 2 w+1 − 2. 

Representing this sum could require w + 1 bits.
