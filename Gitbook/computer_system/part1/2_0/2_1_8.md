Bit-Level Operations in C

One useful feature of C is that it supports bit-wise Boolean operations. 

In fact, the symbols we have used for the Boolean operations are exactly those used by C:
| for Or, 
& for And, 
~ for Not, 
and ^ for Exclusive-Or. 

These can be applied to any “integral” data type, that is, 
one declared as type char or int, 

with or without qualifiers such as short, long, long long, or unsigned. 

Here are some examples of expression evaluation for data type char:

As our examples show, 
the best way to determine the effect of a bit-level expression is to 
expand the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations,

perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to hexadecimal.

One common use of bit-level operations is to implement masking operations,

where a mask is a bit pattern that indicates a selected set of bits within a word. 

As an example, the mask 0xFF (having ones for the least significant 8 bits) 
indicates the low-order byte of a word. 

The bit-level operation x & 0xFF yields a value consisting of the least significant byte of x, 
but with all other bytes set to 0.

For example, with x = 0x89ABCDEF, the expression would yield 0x000000EF.
The expression ~0 will yield a mask of all ones, 
regardless of the word size of the machine. 

Although the same mask can be written 0xFFFFFFFF for a 32-bit machine, 
such code is not as portable.
