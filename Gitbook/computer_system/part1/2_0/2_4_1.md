Fractional Binary Numbers

A first step in understanding floating-point numbers is to consider binary numbers having fractional values. 

Let us first examine the more familiar decimal notation.

The weighting of the digits is defined relative to the decimal point symbol (‘.’),

meaning that digits to the left are weighted by positive powers of 10, 

giving integral values, while digits to the right are weighted by negative powers of 10, giving fractional values.

```
12.34 = 1*10^1 + 1*10^0+3*10^-1+4*10^-2
```

By analogy, 

consider a notation of the form, where each binary digit, or bit, 

b i ranges between 0 and 1, as is illustrated in Figure 2.30. 

This notation represents a number b defined as

The symbol ‘.’ now becomes a binary point, 

with bits on the left being weighted by positive powers of 2, 

and those on the right being weighted by negative powers of 2. 

```
(binary) 0.01 = 0*2^0+0*2^-1+1*2^-2 = (digit) 0.25
```
