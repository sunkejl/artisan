Representing Code
When compiled on our sample machines, 
we generate machine code having the following byte representations:

Here we find that the instruction codings are different. 

Different machine types use different and incompatible instructions and encodings. 

Even identical processors running different operating systems have differences 
in their coding conventions and hence are not binary compatible. 

Binary code is seldom portable across different combinations of machine and operating system.

A fundamental concept of computer systems is that a program, 
from the perspective of the machine, is simply a sequence of bytes. 

The machine has no information about the original source program, 

except perhaps some auxiliary tables maintained to aid in debugging. 

We will see this more clearly when we study machine-level programming in Chapter 3.

Operations of Boolean algebra. 
Binary values 1 and 0 encode logic values
True and False, 

while operations ~ , & , | , and ^ 
encode logical operations Not, And, Or, and Exclusive-Or, respectively.
