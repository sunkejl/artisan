Integer Representations
In this section, we describe two different ways bits can be used to encode integers-

one that can only represent nonnegative numbers, 

and one that can represent negative, zero, and positive numbers. 

We will see later that they are strongly related both in their mathematical properties 
and their machine-level implementations. 

We also investigate the effect of expanding or shrinking an encoded integer 
to fit a representation with a different length.

square brackets is optional.
