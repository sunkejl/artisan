2.4.4
Rounding

Floating-point arithmetic can only approximate real arithmetic, 

since the representation has limited range and precision. 

Thus, for a value x, we generally want a systematic method of finding the “closest” matching value x 

that can be represented in the desired floating-point format. 

This is the task of the rounding operation. 

One key problem is to define the direction to round a value that is halfway between two possibilities. 

For example, if I have $1.50 and want to round it to the nearest dollar, 
should the result be $1 or $2? 

An alternative approach is to maintain a lower and an upper bound on the actual number.
