2.2.4
Conversions Between Signed and Unsigned

C allows casting between different numeric data types. 

For example, suppose variable x is declared as int and u as unsigned. 

The expression (unsigned) x converts the value of x to an unsigned value, 
and (int) u converts the value of u to a signed integer. 

What should be the effect of casting signed value to unsigned,
or vice versa? 

From a mathematical perspective, one can imagine several different conventions. 

Clearly, we want to preserve any value that can be represented in both forms. On the other hand, 

converting a negative value to unsigned might yield zero. 

Converting an unsigned value that is too large to be represented in twoâ€™s-complement form might yield TMax. 

For most implementations of C, however, the answer to this question is based on a bit-level perspective, 
rather than on a numeric one.
