2.2.5
Signed vs. Unsigned in C

C supports both signed and unsigned arithmetic for all of its integer data types. 

Although the C standard does not specify a particular representation of signed numbers, 

almost all machines use two’s complement. Generally, most numbers are signed by default. 

For example, when declaring a constant such as 12345 or 0x1A2B, the value is considered signed. 

Adding character ‘U’ or ‘u’ as a suffix creates an unsigned constant, e.g., 12345U or 0x1A2Bu.


C allows conversion between unsigned and signed. 

The rule is that the underlying bit representation is not changed. 

Thus, on a two’s-complement machine, the effect is to apply the function U2T w when converting from unsigned to signed, 

and T2U w when converting from signed to unsigned, where w is the number of bits for the data type.
