php 5.4的变化
PHP 5.4, comes with all the bells and whistles you might dream of in a modern web language: 
yes, PHP supports namespaces; 
yes, PHP supports closures; 
yes, PHP supports traits.

It took some time, 
but PHP 5.4 also comes with some nice syntactic sugar that makes the whole experience better than ever:
yes, PHP supports [] to define arrays; 
yes, PHP supports calling a method on a newly created object ((new Foo())->bar()); 
yes, PHP supports getting an array item from any expression ($foo->bar()[1]).
