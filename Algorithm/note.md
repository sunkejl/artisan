####Characteristics of a Data Structure

Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

Time Complexity(复杂度) − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.

Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

Worst Case

Average Case 

Best Case

####Basic Terminology

Data − Data are values or set of values.

Data Item − Data item refers to single unit of values.

Group Items − Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.

Elementary Items − Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.

Attribute and Entity − An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.

Entity Set − Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.

Field − Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.

Record − Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.

File − File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.

####categories(类别) of algorithms 

Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.

Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.

Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.

Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.

Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.
