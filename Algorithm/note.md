####Characteristics of a Data Structure

Correctness − Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.

Time Complexity(复杂度) − Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.

Space Complexity − Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

* Worst Case
* Average Case 
* Best Case

####Basic Terminology

Data − Data are values or set of values.

Data Item − Data item refers to single unit of values.

Group Items − Data items that are divided into sub items are called as Group Items.

Elementary Items − Data items that cannot be divided are called as Elementary Items.

Attribute and Entity − An entity is that which contains certain attributes or properties, which may be assigned values.

Entity Set − Entities of similar attributes form an entity set.

Field − Field is a single elementary unit of information representing an attribute of an entity.

Record − Record is a collection of field values of a given entity.

File − File is a collection of records of the entities in a given entity set.

####categories(类别) of algorithms 

* Search − Algorithm to search an item in a data structure.
* Sort − Algorithm to sort items in a certain order.
* Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a data structure.
* Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure.
* Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure.

####time required 
* Best Case − Minimum time required for program execution.
* Average Case − Average time required for program execution.
* Worst Case − Maximum time required for program execution.

####common asymptotic notations
* constant	−	Ο(1)
* logarithmic	−	Ο(logn)
* linear	−	Ο(n)
* n log n	−	Ο(nlogn)
* quadratic	−	Ο(n2)
* cubic	−	Ο(n3)
* polynomial(多项式)	−	nΟ1
* exponential(指数)	−	2Οn

####divide and conquer

Divide/Break
breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems.
takes a recursive approach to divide the problem until no sub-problem is further divisible. 

Conquer/Solve
receives a lot of smaller sub-problems to be solved. 

Merge/Combine
this stage recursively combines them until they formulate a solution of the original problem. 
This algorithmic approach works recursively and conquer & merge steps works so close that they appear as one.

Examples

The following computer algorithms are based on divide-and-conquer programming approach 
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Binary Search

####DATA STRUCTURES

Data Object represents an object having a data.

Data Type
* Built-in Data Type  (Integers Boolean{true,false} float{Decimal numbers} Strings)
* Derived(派生) Data Type (List Array Stack Queue)

Basic Operations
* Traversing(遍历)
* Searching
* Insertion
* Deletion
* Sorting
* Merging

Array
* Element  each item store in an array 
* Index numerical index  to identify the element 

type size name element index length

* basic operations
* travers
* insertion
* deletion
* search
* update
